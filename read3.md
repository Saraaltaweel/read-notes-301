## Javascript Templating
#### Mustache
 *is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.*

example:
`Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });`
` returns: Hello, Sherlynn`

here we but to braces around name this is mustache syntax to show that it is a placeholder.

## UPDATING ELEMENTS :
- html() This method gives every element in the matched set the same new content.
- text() This method gives every element in the matched set the same new text content.
- replaceWith() This method replaces every element in a matched set with new content.
- remove() This method removes all of the elements in the matched set.

## Flexbox
The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties.

## Prefixing Flexbox
Flexbox requires some vendor prefixing to support the most browsers possible. It doesn’t just include prepending properties with the vendor prefix, but there are actually entirely different property and value names.
