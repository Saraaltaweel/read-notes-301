## Database normalization
 *a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The idea is that a table should be about a specific topic and that only those columns which support that topic are included. For example, a spreadsheet containing information about sales people and customers serves several purposes:*

- Identify sales people in your organization
- List all customers your company calls upon to sell product
- Identify which sales people call on specific customers

**There are three main reasons to normalize a database:**

1. to minimize duplicate data.
1. to minimize or avoid data modification issues.
1. to simplify queries.
